## Stage-1: Inform
This is the first step of FinOps team needs to do. In this stage, the most important part is defining Unit Cost Metrics.

**MOF** provide users a pre-defined unit cost metrics. Furthermore, user can define unit cost metrics by simply adding tags into resources.

In the **Home** page, **MOF** aggregates data across all providers.

In the **Analysis** page, user can select cloud provider. Otherwise, resource tree chart will be shown to user.

## Stage-2: Optimize
This is the second step of FinOps. **MOF** will automatically generate optimizations in current cloud account. 

## Stage-3: Operate
As soon as user get notified with optimization plans, user need to operate based on plans. 

Currently, **MOF** does not do any operations with user account. In the future, **MOF** will getting smarter to operate automatically.
